# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* Being kind and respectful in all interactions
* Welcoming newcomers — everyone was new once
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being patient with questions, especially from those learning
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
* Showing empathy towards other community members
* Acknowledging mistakes, apologising to those affected, and learning from the experience

Examples of unacceptable behavior:

* Harassment of any kind, public or private
* Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
* Personal or political attacks
* Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
* Sustained disruption of discussions or code review
* Sexual or violent language or imagery
* Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of
Conduct and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any
behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned
to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions
when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies in all community spaces — GitHub Issues, Pull
Requests, Discussions, and any other official communication channel — and also
applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project maintainers at **conduct@geal.ai**. All complaints will
be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Maintainers are obligated to
maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Maintainers will follow these guidelines in determining consequences:

### 1. Correction
**Impact:** Minor, first-time violation.
**Consequence:** A private written warning with clarity around what was
inappropriate and why. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning
**Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time.

### 3. Temporary Ban
**Impact:** A serious violation of community standards.
**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any public interaction or contribution
for a specified period of time.

### 4. Permanent Ban
**Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards,
including sustained harassment, aggression, or disparagement of individuals.
**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any public interaction within the project.
